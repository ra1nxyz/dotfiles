dotfiles for my arch setup, not meant to be used by other people so a lot of stuff is just rubber banded.

feel free to try and use

scripts folder goes to home/$user/ not ~.config

packages:
(includes non configurated stuff for my own easier recall)
yay wofi waybar wallust vesktop qt6 qt5 qbittorent pipewire wireplumber pavucontrol opentabletdriver obs-studio mpv ffmpeg kate htop hyprland fastfetch cmus cava alacritty osu-wine godot pulseaudio

some stuff is probably missing from this ^, meant to be mostly minimal for transporting configs to my work laptop

since no fine tuned script installer, i recommend only applying configs once within an environment through a graphical file browser one by one
